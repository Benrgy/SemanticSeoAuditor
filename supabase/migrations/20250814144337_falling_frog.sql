  # Fix Audit RLS Policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Create new policies that allow anonymous users to create and read their own audits
    - Allow authenticated users to read their own audits
    - Enable public audit creation for anonymous users

  2. Policy Changes
    - Enable audit creation for both anonymous and authenticated users
    - Allow users to read audits they created (including anonymous audits)
    - Maintain security while fixing the RLS blocking issue
